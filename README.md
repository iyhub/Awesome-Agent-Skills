# Awesome Agent Skills

Awesome-Agent-Skills is a curated list of practical, real-world agent skills that are actually useful in production and daily work.

Unlike generic prompt collections, this repository focuses on actionable agent capabilities — skills that combine reasoning, tools, workflows, and domain knowledge to solve concrete problems.

The skills are organized from two complementary perspectives:
	•	By Role (Target Audience)
Such as developers, data scientists, product managers, researchers, marketers, operators, founders, and more.
	•	By Use Case (What the Agent Can Do)
Such as coding assistance, data analysis, research automation, content generation, decision support, workflow automation, monitoring, and knowledge management.

Each agent skill aims to be:
	•	Practical – grounded in real tasks people do at work
	•	Reusable – applicable across projects and teams
	•	Composable – easy to combine with other skills or agents
	•	Tool-aware – designed to work with real tools, APIs, and environments

This list is intended for:
	•	People building AI agents or agent frameworks
	•	Teams looking for proven agent capabilities to adopt
	•	Anyone who wants to understand what agents are actually good at today

Contributions are welcome. If you have a useful agent skill that solves a real problem, feel free to share it.
